# CCI_Check_Permutation_1_2
Initialize project CCI - Check Permutation 1.2

This program is a solution to CCI check permutation problem 1.2. Given two strings write a method to decide
if one is permutation of the other.

The isPermutation method will check for both string objects length to see if they are NOT the same and return
false if that is the case. Else both strings will be passed to the String sort methods and both returned string
objects will be compared to see if they are equal.
